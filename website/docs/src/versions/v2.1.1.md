# V - 2.1.1

## Sync issues

This update fixes an issue introduced in [Version 2.1.0](./v2.1.0.md) that stops all syncing features.

If you have notices that your experience isn't updating or reminders are missing after logging in, this was the cause of that.

## Another minor fixes
- Welcome screen will be shown only once after installation.
