# V - 2.1.0-a1

This update brings exciting news! A new login method and much more..

## Login
Now login in is optional, you can enter anonymously and use the app normally.

But i will encourage to login and enjoy this perks:

- Be a part of the community.
- Submit support tickets.
- Automatic data backup in the cloud.
- Public profile to climb the leaderboards.

This can be done from the settings menu.

## Ui

Thanks for the feedback, the ui was a bit complicated and unintuitive.

So now the selected reminder is on the Home screen with the ON / OFF button.

All your reminders are now located in the Account screen.

## Fixes
- What's new screen not showing on updates.
- Translation errors.
- Editing the name not updating it on the cloud correctly.
- Profile not updating when using multiple accounts.
- Panda animation not showing the first time it was unlocked.
